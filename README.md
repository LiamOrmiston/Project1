# Project1
Designing a scheduling client that allows users to create events and designate times available for said events.

Modes

  System Admin Mode allows users to create new calendar events by selecting a date for the event and a set of times that they are available.
    
  Adjust Availablity Mode allows users to see a list of previously created events and add a set of times that they are available for that event.
